# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation Suite

This documentation suite provides a comprehensive, structured approach to project management at OctoAcme. It centralizes institutional knowledge, streamlines onboarding, and promotes transparency, repeatability, and continuous improvement across all projects and teams.

## Overview of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme’s project management methodology is grounded in iterative delivery, customer-first prioritization, and clear ownership of outcomes. Projects begin with a formal initiation phase, establishing the problem statement, stakeholder alignment, success metrics, and initial planning artifacts. Teams advance through well-defined stages: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release & Deployment, Risk Management & Communication, and Retrospective/Continuous Improvement, each guided by checklists, templates, and clear deliverables.

Roles and responsibilities are mapped for clarity: Product Managers set vision and prioritize roadmaps; Project Managers coordinate schedules and risks; Developers focus on implementation and quality; QA/Testing ensures reliability; and Stakeholders provide inputs and approvals. Communication is maintained via standups, weekly syncs, demos, and milestone-based updates, utilizing structured templates for risks and incidents. Quality assurance integrates automated and manual testing, with regular reviews and iterative feedback built into workflows.

By collecting and versioning these processes in one place, OctoAcme empowers every team member to work with standardized procedures, reducing knowledge silos and ensuring that validated improvements shape living documentation.
